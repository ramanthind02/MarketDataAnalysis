# Market Data Analysis

From this project we use forex information obtained from calling OANDA APIs
to come to conclusions about market volatility and determine patterns in 
market upturns or downturns. This information can be used alongside other data sources
to analyze how global events can shape the market responses.

## Data Acquisition
- OANDA API to get information about foreign exchange values.
- News APIs. Scheduled events (CPI, FOMC).

## What is the problem? What are we trying to solve?
Are the markets following a random walk? (Are the markets random?)

- Are there periods of volatility that we can measure?
- Can markets affect other markets, are there relationships between them?

## Data Analysis
- Hidden Markov Models - volatility
- Regression - market co-integration
- Probability - risk analysis
